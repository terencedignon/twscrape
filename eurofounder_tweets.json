For SaaS? Are you guys insane?\"\n\n\"Software is a human right in Denmark\"\n\nThe American obnoxiously left the stage and tried to flee the country\n\nHe was arrested at the Copenhagen airport and put in the Danish maximum security prison\n\nAnd the attendee who bravely stood up during the presentation?\n\nHe is now Denmark's new Minister of Innovation\n\nThis is what justice in a sustainable economy looks like",

Did I mess up my dates?\"\n\n\"It's Friday?\"\n\n\"???\"\n\n\"Nobody works past 12pm on Fridays, it's almost weekend\"\n\n\"Can we at least review the term sheet?\"\n\n\"Not without Klaus from legal, but he's on paternity leave until 2026\"\n\n\"Oh come on, let's run through details over lunch\"\n\nThat was enough of this yankee disrespect\n\nThe founder reported him to the German compliance office for disrupting a mandatory 45-minute lunch break\n\nThe VC was escorted out by security\n\nThe company received a \u20ac300k EU grant instead, smart money\n\nThis is why we don't need American money poisoning European sustainable innovation culture",

This isn't America\" cashier responded\n\nThe American tried to leave again but luckily security blocked the exit\n\n\"You didn't get your receipt for tax purposes\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nStore manager appeared with a form\n\n\"Did you attempt to give our cashier extra money?\"\n\n\"That's unreported income. He has to declare it now. Pay social contributions. It becomes \u20ac0.24 after tax\"\n\nThe American was baffled\n\n\"Bro but in the US\u2014\"\n\n\"In the US, workers beg for tips because they're underpaid. Here, we pay living wages\" manager swiftly interrupted him\n\nThey made him take his \u20ac0.50 back and quickly filed an incident report for \"attempted tax circumvention\"\n\nThis is what a properly functioning society looks like",

Then you file it with your labor authority. Then you create role definitions. Then you post positions internally first. Then external posting. Then interviews. Then works council approval\n\n\"Brooo maybe in Europe no wonder you guys don't ship anything meaningful\"\n\nMy heart rate spiked and I felt physically sick listening to that half-brained nonsense talk\n\nThis is why European companies prevail and American startups fail so often\n\nScaling without proper procedures is just a one-way ticket to bankruptcy",

Appoint a DPO. Conduct DPIA assessments. Implement GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with every vendor\"\n\n\"You'll need to localize data storage for France, Germany has different rules, and don't even get me started on cross-border data transfers post-Schrems II\"\n\nHer smile faded, and she asked how long all those things take\n\n\"If you move fast? 12-16 months. But don't rush it as you could face fines up to 4% of global revenue\"\n\nShe called her investors and cancelled the fundraise\n\nShe will sort out compliance first before trying to raise again\n\nProbably saved her company from destroying itself\n\nFeels good to be a mentor to inexperienced founders",
